## About

It is a turn-based multiplayer game. Where people enter and create a room. Other people hop into the room.

Then the game begins where all players are shuffled and first-person gets the chance to pick the football-player he wants. He can search from the list of players (viewing their stats, position, ratings, and other details) and confirm his selection within the allocation time. Now, the turn is passed to another player.

This repeats until every person has picked their whole football squad. There are various modes you can choose from

Different Modes include:
- **Classic Mode** - Classic Football turn based draft
- **Money in the Bank Mode** - Football Draft with bettings and selling of players

## Usage

* Play with your custom teams now :)
